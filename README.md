# challenge-1-accessibility-SEO

I modified the starter code so that it aligned better with accessibility standards and improved the website's SEO. The starter code needed semantic html elements, descriptions of the images for improved accessibility, and a title.

## Usage

This is a static website with information about a fake company and its services.
